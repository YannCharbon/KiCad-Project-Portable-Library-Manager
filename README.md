# Information
This tools allows to add a local and portable component library to a freshly created KiCad project. 

The project can then be shared with other people without them needing to have all the components (symbol/footprint/3d package) in their global library.

The tool can also import components from an existing project that contains a compatible library.
It is also possible to automatically import a component downloaded from Samacsys - Component Search Engine in zip format.

# Installation
The compiled tool can be directly download [from this link](https://github.com/YannCharbon/KiCad-Project-Portable-Library-Manager/raw/master/KiCad%20Project%20Library%20Manager/bin/Release/KiCad%20Project%20Library%20Manager.exe).

The tool has only been tested with `KiCad 5.1.10`. Other version may work but it is not guaranteed.

# Additional information
This is a personnal tool that developped to be able to share KiCad more easily with other people. Thus, it may contain several bugs that I didn't considered because they do not conflict with the use I do of the tool.

I may improve this tool in the futur so feel free to report if you get any issue.
